# External API Integration System - PRD

## Executive Summary
Design and implement a robust external API integration system that connects RepoGuard with third-party security scanning services and development tools.

---

## Epic: External API Integration Hub

Build a comprehensive API integration system that enables seamless connectivity with external security scanners, code analysis tools, and development platforms to enhance RepoGuard's analysis capabilities.

### User Story 1: Security Scanner API Integration
**As a security-conscious developer,**  
**I want RepoGuard to integrate with external vulnerability scanners,**  
**so that I can get comprehensive security analysis beyond basic pattern matching.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integrate with at least 2 security scanning APIs (Snyk, GitHub Security)
- Automatically trigger scans when code changes are detected
- Parse and normalize results from different scanner formats
- Cache scan results to avoid redundant API calls
- Handle API rate limits and retry logic gracefully
- Display unified security findings in reports

### User Story 2: CI/CD Platform Integration  
**As a DevOps engineer,**  
**I want RepoGuard to send analysis results to our CI/CD pipeline,**  
**so that quality gates can automatically pass or fail builds based on RepoGuard findings.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support webhook delivery to CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab)
- Include structured analysis data in webhook payloads
- Allow configuration of quality thresholds for build failures
- Provide status badges and build status updates
- Support custom webhook templates for different platforms
- Include retry logic for webhook delivery failures
