## Epic: User Role and Permission Management

Build a flexible user management system that supports multiple user roles, granular permissions, and team-based access control for RepoGuard features and repository access.

### User Story 1: User Role Assignment
**As an administrator,**  
**I want to assign different roles to users (admin, developer, viewer),**  
**so that I can control what features and data each user can access.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support three primary roles: Admin, Developer, Viewer
- Admin can create, modify, and delete user accounts
- Developer can access code analysis and create reports
- Viewer can only view reports and dashboards
- Role changes take effect immediately across all sessions
- Audit log tracks all role assignment changes

### User Story 2: Repository Access Control
**As a team lead,**  
**I want to control which repositories each team member can access,**  
**so that sensitive projects remain secure and isolated.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can be granted access to specific repositories
- Support both individual and team-based permissions
- Repository access can be read-only or read-write
- Access changes are reflected in real-time
- Users see only repositories they have permission to access
- Access denied errors provide clear feedback to users
