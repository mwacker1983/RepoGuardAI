## Epic 1: User Authentication and Authorization

Build a comprehensive user authentication system that allows users to securely register, login, and manage their accounts while accessing RepoGuard features based on their permissions.

### User Story 1.1: User Registration
**As a new user,**  
**I want to create an account with my email and password,**  
**so that I can access RepoGuard's code analysis features.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can register with email address and secure password
- Email validation is performed before account activation  
- Password must meet security requirements (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)
- User receives email confirmation for account activation
- Duplicate email addresses are prevented

### User Story 1.2: User Login and Session Management
**As a registered user,**  
**I want to login securely and stay logged in across sessions,**  
**so that I can access my repositories and analysis reports without repeated authentication.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can login with email and password
- Failed login attempts are limited and logged
- Session tokens are securely managed and expire appropriately
- User can logout and invalidate session
- "Remember me" option for extended sessions
