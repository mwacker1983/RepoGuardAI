## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **Master n8n workflow automation** through practical application to real-world GitHub code quality challenges, achieving intermediate-to-advanced proficiency by Month 2
- **Eliminate AI-generated scope creep** by implementing automated detection patterns that catch 85%+ of unwanted features, complexity, and over-engineering in commits  
- **Reduce manual code review time** from 25+ hours/week to under 10 hours/week while maintaining or improving code quality standards
- **Build portfolio-ready automation expertise** with comprehensive documentation and working demos suitable for freelance differentiation by September 2024
- **Create foundation for business evolution** with architecture that supports future multi-tenant SaaS deployment with minimal refactoring effort
- **Establish reliable quality processes** that provide confidence for handling multiple concurrent client projects during independence transition

### Background Context

You're transitioning from 10 years of employment safety to independent freelance/SaaS work by September 2024, creating existential pressure around code quality where AI mistakes become YOUR mistakes legally and financially. Currently, AI coding assistants consistently add unrequested features like rate limiting, complex error handling, and over-engineered solutions, requiring 25+ hours weekly of manual review that doesn't scale with productivity demands.

This system serves as both a practical solution to immediate AI assistant pain points and a comprehensive n8n learning laboratory. The automation will provide the quality confidence needed for larger client projects while demonstrating workflow automation expertise that differentiates your consulting services in the competitive market.

---

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The system prioritizes **developer-focused utility over visual polish**, with clean, scannable reports that quickly surface critical information. The primary interface is the n8n visual workflow editor for configuration, supplemented by generated HTML reports that serve dual purposes: immediate actionable insights for you and professional portfolio demonstrations for potential clients.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
**Configuration-driven automation** where complex logic is managed through n8n's visual workflow interface, requiring minimal direct UI interaction once configured. Reports follow **information hierarchy patterns** with critical issues (security, scope violations) prominently displayed, followed by trends and detailed metrics in expandable sections.

### Core Screens and Views
- **n8n Workflow Dashboard** - Primary configuration and monitoring interface (leveraging n8n's native UI)
- **Quality Analysis Reports** - Generated HTML pages showing commit analysis results, complexity trends, and security findings
- **Scope Violation Alerts** - Focused views highlighting detected AI-generated feature additions and over-engineering patterns
- **Portfolio Documentation Pages** - Professional presentation of automation capabilities and results for client demonstrations
- **Audit Trail Views** - Detailed logs of analysis decisions and workflow execution for learning and troubleshooting

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Reports must meet WCAG AA standards for professional client presentation, with proper heading hierarchy, color contrast ratios, and keyboard navigation support. This ensures portfolio materials are accessible to all potential clients and demonstrates attention to quality standards.

### Branding
**Technical professionalism with automation focus** - Clean, monospace typography for code-related content, muted color palette that doesn't distract from data, with subtle visual indicators for different alert severities. Visual design should reinforce expertise and reliability rather than flashy aesthetics, suitable for B2B consulting presentations.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
HTML reports must render properly on desktop browsers (primary development use) and mobile devices (client review scenarios). n8n workflow management remains desktop-focused for complexity requirements, but generated outputs must be accessible across platforms for maximum portfolio flexibility.

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
**Single repository containing all n8n workflows, documentation, generated reports, and configuration files.** This approach supports your learning objectives by keeping all automation components together, simplifies portfolio presentation, and reduces complexity during the n8n skill development phase. Easy to refactor to multi-repo structure when scaling to business use.

### Service Architecture
**n8n-powered microservices architecture using visual workflow chains as discrete service components.** Webhook receivers, analysis processors, security scanners, and report generators exist as separate but connected n8n workflows. This design teaches advanced n8n orchestration patterns while maintaining modularity for progressive feature addition and portfolio demonstration of complex automation capabilities.

### Testing Requirements
**Integration testing focused on workflow validation with manual verification checkpoints for AI detection accuracy.** Given the visual workflow nature of n8n, testing emphasizes end-to-end webhook-to-report validation rather than traditional unit tests. Manual verification of scope creep detection builds pattern recognition skills while ensuring system reliability before September independence deadline.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Platform & Infrastructure:**
- **Self-hosted n8n deployment** using Docker containers for complete control over learning environment and cost management
- **PostgreSQL database** for production-ready data persistence patterns and advanced SQL learning opportunities 
- **GitHub API integration** as primary external service with proper webhook signature verification and rate limiting
- **Cloud deployment capability** (AWS/DigitalOcean) for portfolio demonstration and reliability learning beyond local development

**Development Environment:**
- **Windows development environment** accommodation with Docker Desktop for n8n workflows
- **Visual Studio Code integration** for workflow documentation and markdown report template development
- **Git-based workflow management** with systematic branching for different n8n workflow experiments and learning phases

**Security & API Management:**
- **Environment variable management** for API keys and webhook secrets using n8n's credential system
- **Webhook signature verification** for GitHub integration security learning and production readiness
- **Local-first processing** to avoid exposing proprietary code to external analysis services unless explicitly chosen

**Learning & Portfolio Requirements:**
- **Comprehensive workflow documentation** with decision rationale and n8n pattern explanations for consulting presentation
- **Progressive complexity implementation** starting with basic webhooks and advancing to complex conditional logic and error handling
- **Reusable component library** development within n8n for demonstrating systematic automation methodology
