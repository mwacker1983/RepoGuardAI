- Support biometric authentication for secure access

### User Story 2: Quick Code Review Features
**As a team lead reviewing code remotely,**  
**I want to perform basic code review tasks from my mobile device,**  
**so that I can keep development workflows moving without access to my laptop.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- View diff highlights for pull request changes
- Add inline comments on specific code lines
- Approve or request changes on pull requests
- View and respond to existing review comments
- Search and filter pull requests by author, status, or repository
